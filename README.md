## Background  
In today’s hyperconnected world, loneliness persists as a profound challenge. Our program, *Ryan BL*, is designed to address this emotional gap by immersing users in a heartfelt and interactive dating simulation. The goal is to cultivate connections, explore emotional depth, and engage in an enriching narrative experience that celebrates companionship and love.

## Scenario  
Imagine Alex, a college student navigating the ups and downs of academic life, feeling the weight of isolation after moving to a new city. They stumble upon *Ryan BL*, a captivating dating simulation where the protagonist, Ryan, becomes their virtual confidant and friend. Through playful banter, emotional storytelling, and decision-making, Alex finds themselves not only entertained but also uplifted, developing an appreciation for the complexities of relationships.

## Why Users Would Use This Program  
*Ryan BL* is perfect for users seeking:  
- Emotional connection through a story-rich simulation.  
- A safe space to explore romantic or platonic relationships without judgment.  
- Entertainment that prioritizes immersive narrative over fast-paced mechanics.  

## Features  
- **Unskippable Scenes**: Guarantees every scene is experienced, maximizing narrative impact.  
- **Affection Meter**: Tracks the relationship's status and provides real-time feedback on choices, starting with a “besties” level of 50/100.  
- **Dynamic Respawning Mechanic**: If Ryan dies, the player gets another chance to repair their bond, adding emotional stakes.  
- **Marriage Pathway**: Reaching 80 affection or higher allows players to unlock the ultimate milestone: marriage with Ryan.  

## Gameplay  
Players step into the shoes of a character who has the opportunity to develop a bond with Ryan, a dynamic and endearing protagonist. The game is designed as a guided experience where players navigate a series of carefully crafted scenes. Unlike other dating sims, skipping scenes is not an option, ensuring that players fully engage with each moment of the story.

The progression hinges on an **Affection Meter**, starting at a balanced 50/100 to symbolize a budding friendship. Players' decisions directly influence the meter. Key moments allow the player to deepen their relationship with Ryan, culminating in the possibility of marriage if affection reaches a minimum of 80. However, if Ryan dies (through dramatic or humorous plot twists), they will respawn in the same scene, albeit with 10 fewer affection points, challenging the player to rebuild the relationship.
